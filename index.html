	<p><h1>Emma Zimmerman</h1></p>
	<p>I've always been a DIY-er. Why buy something when you can build it? Turns out that attitude extends to websites too.</p>
	<p>So here I am in RampUp: adding a new skill to my resume and getting the satisfaction of building something myself. I work for Startup Institute, so I suppose it's in my very nature to want to hack things together. Learning on your own isn't much fun though. I'm excited to take my marketing career to the next level by designing emails and helping our developers style the Startup Institute website.</p>
